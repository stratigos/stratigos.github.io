A Weekly Retrospective Meeting is a recurring event which maintains expectations, encourages open communication, and keeps a team on track with their goals. If an agile project can be seen as a running program, then the retrospective is the main loop. It is the point of iteration where wins can be celebrated, courses can be corrected, grievances are aired, and preparations for the future can be made. A retrospective meeting typically focuses on the following three questions:

* What went well?
* What can be improved?
* What actions shall we plan next?
