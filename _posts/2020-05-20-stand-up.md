A Daily Stand Up Meeting is a daily event for a team to maintain cohesion and accountability. It consists of each team member reporting the following three things to their team:

* What did I do yesterday?
* What do I plan to do today?
* What is blocking me?

This structure has a few purposes. It helps a team maintain focus on the current project or sprint. Stand-ups provide transparency for the team and its leadership. This meeting is an opportunity to help one another. Stand-ups are also an opportunity to build trust, and to foster cultural values.

To receive optimal value from a stand-up, keep reports concise. I recommend meeting at 10 am for 10 minutes, every work day.

The stand up meeting is most effective when kept to this simple structure. Adding more items to the above list, such as discussing solutions to blockages, can easily cause the meeting to become a daily disruption and result in a loss of focus.

If there are blockages that can't be immediately resolved, have the relevant people meet right after stand-up to discuss a solution. Pair programming is a typical unblocker.

In a follow-up blog post, I'll discuss how to implement a cultural framework for successful stand-ups, and how to manage the sort of challenges that can reduce their value.
