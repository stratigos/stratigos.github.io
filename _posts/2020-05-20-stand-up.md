## What is a Daily Stand Up Meeting?

A Daily Stand Up Meeting is a daily event for a team to maintain cohesion and accountability. It consists of each team member reporting the following three things to their team:

* What did I do yesterday?
* What do I plan to do today?
* What is blocking me?

This structure has a few purposes. It helps a team maintain focus on the current project or sprint. Standups provide transparency for the team and its leadership. It is also an opportunity to help one another. Standups are also an opportunity to build trust and foster cultural values.

The stand up meeting is most effective when strictly kept to this simple structure.


For a large enough team, a facilitator can help maintain focus on these three items.
