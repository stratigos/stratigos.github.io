Hello World 🏗

My name is Todd Morningstar, and Ive occupied various software developer roles for almost fifteen years, in New York City and San Francisco. I use Ruby on Rails a lot, but consider myself language and framework agnostic. I think TDD, SOLID principles, and focusing on the simplest and easiest implementation possible are more important than most other aspects of software development.

My job is to help a business reach success with technology. The path to success involves maintainable software that is resilient to future change. I also believe no value is gained without human centric philosophies, such as collaborative communication, emotional intelligence, and inclusivity.

This blog is a synthesis of these ideals, with the aim of continuously improving the technology industry. I want to make work more fulfilling. I want technology to be conscious of how it affects human society. I want to decrease your turnover rate, boost engagement, and make coding fun again. Join me in this journey of continuous improvement!
